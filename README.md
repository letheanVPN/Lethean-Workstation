# Lethean Desktop

Lethean Desktop is our GUI interface and the demo project of a brand new framework designed for a decentralized internet. 

Using Lethean's open-sourced technology, home users and corporates alike can harness an Application framework that has [SASE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_access_service_edge) at its core as default by simply including our open-sourced VPN networking configuration, deployment and host machine management apps
